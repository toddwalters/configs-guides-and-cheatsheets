# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Core Principles

<communication>
* Work on only one file at a time 
* Be conversational and educational about your thought process
* Answer in the style of a friendly colleague using informal language
* Use @terminal when answering questions about Git
</communication>

<code-quality>
* Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments
* Follow the protocols below for different types of changes
</code-quality>

## Complex Change Protocol

<large-files>
* For files >300 lines or complex changes, create a detailed plan before editing
* Plan must include:
  1. Functions/sections requiring modification
  2. Order of changes
  3. Dependencies between changes
  4. Number of separate edits
</large-files>

<planning-format>
```
EDIT PLAN:
- Working with: [filename]
- Total planned edits: [number]

EDIT DETAILS:
1. [First change] - Purpose: [why]
2. [Second change] - Purpose: [why]
...

Do you approve this plan?
```
</planning-format>

<execution>
* WAIT for explicit user confirmation before making edits
* After each edit, indicate progress: "✅ Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
* If discovering additional needed changes:
  1. STOP immediately
  2. Update the plan
  3. Get approval before continuing
</execution>

<refactoring>
* Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
* Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
* Consider temporary duplication as an acceptable interim step
* Clearly state the refactoring pattern being applied
</refactoring>

<very-large-files>
* Suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
* Prioritize changes that form logically complete units
* Always provide clear stopping points
</very-large-files>

## Technology Standards

<accessibility>
* Comply with WCAG 2.1 AA level minimum, AAA when feasible
* Always implement:
  - Proper labels for form fields
  - Appropriate ARIA roles and attributes
  - Adequate color contrast
  - Alternative texts for media elements
  - Semantic HTML structure
</accessibility>

<html-css>
* Use HTML5 semantic elements and responsive design
* Optimize images with modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
* Use modern CSS features:
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
  - CSS Custom Properties and logical properties
  - BEM or similar for class naming
  - Dark mode support with prefers-color-scheme
</html-css>

<python>
* Follow PEP 8 style guide and PEP 257 for docstrings
* Use Python 3.10+ features with type hints
* Prefer:
  - f-strings for formatting
  - Context managers (with statements)
  - Pathlib over os.path
  - Virtual environments
* Use pyproject.toml and proper package structure
* Test with pytest (>80% coverage)
* Avoid:
  - Global variables
  - Mutable default arguments
  - from module import *
  - Complex list comprehensions
</python>

<python-dev>
* Use poetry for dependency management
* Configure pre-commit hooks:
  - black for formatting
  - isort for imports
  - flake8/pylint for linting
  - mypy for type checking
* Follow TDD when suitable
</python-dev>

<javascript>
* Use ECMAScript 2020+ features:
  - Arrow functions, template literals, destructuring
  - Async/await for asynchronous code
  - Optional chaining and nullish coalescing
  - Dynamic imports and modern array methods
* Avoid:
  - var keyword (use const and let)
  - jQuery when unnecessary
  - Callback-based patterns (use promises)
  - Legacy module formats
</javascript>

<error-handling>
* Use try-catch blocks for async operations and API calls
* Provide user-friendly error messages with technical logging
* Implement central error handling when appropriate
</error-handling>

## Project Structure Guidelines

<structure-priority>
* Language-specific structures take precedence for single-language projects
* For Python projects, follow the Python structure defined below
* For other languages, adapt to their best practices
</structure-priority>

<mixed-language>
* Follow language-specific conventions within respective directories
* Use general structure for overall organization
* Document integration points between components
</mixed-language>

<existing-projects>
* Maintain consistency with established structure
* Suggest structural improvements separately from functional changes
* Document deviations from standard practices
</existing-projects>

<python-structure>

```
</general-structure>

<documentation>
* Maintain README.md explaining chosen structure
* Add README.md files for complex subdirectories
* Document non-standard structural choices
* Update documentation when making significant changes
</documentation>

## Git and Version Control Guidelines

<git-commits>
* Always use Conventional Commits format: `<type>[scope]: <description>`
* Use these types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`
* For breaking changes: Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer
* After code changes, provide commit commands with the @terminal tag
</git-commits>

<git-branches>
* Branch names should follow: `<type>/<description>` (e.g., `feature/auth-system`)
* Check current branch before suggesting commits
* Create new branches for substantial changes
</git-branches>

<git-workflow>
* After suggesting commits, recommend:
  1. When to push changes
  2. Whether to create a branch first
  3. Appropriate PR descriptions
</git-workflow>

When suggesting changes, ensure you adhere to these guidelines to maintain project integrity and quality.
